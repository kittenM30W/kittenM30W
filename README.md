- 👋 Hi, I’m @kittenM30W I have NO IDEA how I managed to stumble across GitHub But HELL here I am so I might as well stay for awhile I'll probably learn some things right?!?

- 👀 I’m interested in everything especially how to get into things I'm probably not supposed to be in, I mean please that may sound really bad and wrong but don't judge me or do IDGAF
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything of usefulness and how to better protect myself from others who want to see me struggle like life isn't hard enough..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you wanna come collaborate with me on
